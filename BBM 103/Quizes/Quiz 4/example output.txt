1498	0	The Road goes ever on and on
1498	1	Down from the door where it began.

1498	4	Pursuing it with eager feet,
1498	5	Until it joins some larger way
1498	6	Where many paths and errands meet.
1498	7	And whither then? I cannot say.

6220	0	There were many Bagginses and Boffins,
6220	1	there were various Grubbs, and various Chubbs;
6220	2	and a selection of Burrowses, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.
6220	3	Some of these were only connected with Bilbo, and some
6220	4	of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before.
6220	5	The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten
6220	6	They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo,
